## Hi there 👋
Here's an overview of my projects during the studies of the CSI5186 course at the University of Ottawa, delivered by Professor Shiva Nejati. 
I made some projects and developed my understanding with Fernando Nogueira, during the completion of the course about software verification (as known as "testing") with the modern AI and Large Language Models, at the Fall 2025 term.

**Outstanding Projects:**

🌍 [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://github.com/AI-Enabled-Software-Testing/Traveling-Salesman-Problem)

🛠 [Test Suite Generation](https://github.com/AI-Enabled-Software-Testing/Test-Suite-Generation-AVM)

🧠 [Understanding SAT/SMT Solvers](../../CSI5186_AI_Testing_Assignment_3___Fernando__Kelvin.pdf)

🧪 Hyperparameter Tuning Search for Machine Learning Models (in progress)
